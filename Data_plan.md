  This link has a data table that contains information about the Estimated Prevalence of Serious Mental Illness and Emotional Disturbance in Los Angeles County. We will download the data as an excel file and then import it into VS Code as a csv file. This data set is useful because each service area is separated and contains statistics about gender and ethnicity. The goal for this data set will be to create a map with a polygon layers (each service area is a different color) depicting what the incidence of mental health issues is like. This map will have multiple layers (with data explained below) that the users will be able to turn on/off. This map will contain markers with information about the service area and what mental health looks like in these specific zones.

This layer will have markers with the information about each facility (including name and description).

 This link has census data from Los Angeles including percentages of total population and geographic distribution of all the different racial and ethnic groups within the area. This data will be downloaded as a csv file and import it into VS code to create a map of the demographic distribution in LA by blocks (if possible, by the service areas depicted in the map above). This will be a choropleth map and each area will present a marker when hoovered over with a mouse. The marker will have information about racial and ethnic percentages of the population living in that block.

 This link has data about factors such as home stability and accessibility to mental health services in LA county. For this data we would have to create our own tables and import them as csv files into VS Code. The purpose of this data will be to further our narrative about the effects socioeconomic factors have on mental health treatment/accessibility with a layer on the demographic distribution choropleth map described above. This layer will also include markers with extra information about whcihever factor is being depicted.

 <i>So far these are the visuals that we have in mind but the link below has a couple of more data sets, that if time allows, we would be open to explore and further our narrative (data about substance abuse programs, hospital and care centers, medicare and medicaid offices, health education and counseling, etc):</i>
