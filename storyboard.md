Kate's reaction: I like how logical the flow is and the inclusion of public & private care facilities to map.

Frida's reaction: I really like all the material that is in the map! I think it is a great way to synthesize ideas and also can give us insight as to what we can possibly map about. I like how the ideas so clearly connect to each other and create a narrative within the mindmap.

Kate's reaction: You bring up really important questions about language barriers and gender and their relation to mental health. I also noticed how we both were thinking about the way mental health intersects with other public issues.

Frida's reaction: I really like that historical background idea! I think that it will be very useful in creating a complete idea as to what the issue is and how long it has been happening for. I also really liked how you delineated the narrative in a concise way and how you mentioned community-based approaches to the mental health crisis that LA county, and most of the country, is living in.
