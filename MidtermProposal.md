<b><h1>Mental Health in Los Angeles County</h1></b>

<b>Introduction:</b> 
<br>
<br>
<i>Group name - </i> The health mappers.
<br>
<br>
<i> Group goals - </i> We believe in health equity -- the idea that everybody should have access to healthy lives and life-affirming structures/institutions. With our project we hope to emphasize the lack of mental health accessibility and how this is an issue of racial and economic justice.

Frida Barragan - Group collaborator 1. Fourth year Biology major. I am interested in all aspects of healthcare but specifically in how accessibility to health services is affected by social factors that include income and location and how this intersects with race and ethnicity.

Kate McInerny - Group collaborator 2. Third year Public Affairs major and DH Minor. I’m interested in critical cartography, mapping for racial justice & community-based organizing work. I believe that many of our “social issues” require a public health framework/ holistic approach so that communities can thrive.
<br>
<br>
Because we are a two-person team, we have decided we will split work equally as the project moves forward, rather than assigning strict “roles” for ourselves.
<br>
<br>
<b>Overview:</b>
<br>
<br>
Our group will focus on mental health in Los Angeles -- the availability of mental health facilities across the county, the geospatial politics around mental health, its stigmatization, criminalization, and prioritization across space and time. Our project is on mental health in Los Angeles because it is one of the least accessible services available to individuals living in this area. Understanding mental health is important since it is often overlooked in general discussions of health. Moreover, Los Angeles is currently experiencing a drug and homelessness crisis affecting thousands of individuals, whose mental health necessities are not being attended to and which could potentially result fatal. It is important to understand the needs of individuals living in an area and emphasize the shortcomings of the economic funds that have been allocated towards specific groups of people. Overall, our project is meant to showcase the intersections between lack of mental health services and other social issues that affect millions of lives.
<br>
<br>
<b>Methodology:</b>
<br>
<br>
Web mapping is a useful tool because it uses geographic data to create geospatial visuals of social issues and its various aspects, such as mental health access. We chose this medium because it could potentially create powerful visuals that show exactly how mental health services are unaccessible for certain population groups. Also, could create a perspective as to how much of the population and the locations that are being most affected by mental health accessibility issues.

<b>Technical scope:</b>
<br>
<br>
<i> Git - </i> We will use Git to collaborate on the same files and have a record of the changes that are being made of our code. We will also use it to make sure our data is stored safely and we can always look back at it.  
<br>
<i>Leaflet -</i> We will use this tool to map all of our data sets and add markers to make interactive and appealing images that add to the overall narrative.
<br>
<i> HTML - </i> We will use HTML to display our images in a website that is user friendly and creates an impactful story that highlights the social issues and questions we are raising.
<br>
<i> Javascript - </i> We will use javascript and its functions as our programming language to make our website more interactive and better the user experience. 
<br>
<i> Jupyter - </i> We will use Jupyter to create static maps and map the demographic distributions of the Los Angeles population.
<br>
<i> Tableau - </i> We will use Tableau to create histograms and charts to give variance to our story board and show our data in different ways.
<br>
<i> Visual Studio Code - </i> We will use Visual Studio Code to edit our html code and to make sure that the website we are creating works. We will use it to save our files into Github and push them into our URLs.
<br>
<br>

  Data sets that will be used: 
  <li> https://egis-lacounty.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/44a6f100370c421f9eb837d9608481d3_0/data?geometry=-122.213%2C33.016%2C-114.385%2C34.613&orderBy=Name&orderByAsc=false </li>
  <br>
  This link has a data table that contains information about the Estimated Prevalence of Serious Mental Illness and Emotional Disturbance in Los Angeles County. We will download the data as an excel file and then import it into VS Code as a csv file. This data set is useful because each service area is separated and contains statistics about gender and ethnicity. The goal for this data set will be to create a map with a polygon layers (each service area is a different color) depicting what the incidence of mental health issues is like. This map will have multiple layers (with data explained below) that the users will be able to turn on/off. This map will contain markers with information about the service area and what mental health looks like in these specific zones.

 <br>
 This link includes a data table with information about all the mental health programs in Los Angeles county. We will download the data as a csv file and import it into VS Code. This data will be used as a layer within the map outlined above, in which users will have the ability to turn on/off the layers. This layer will have markers with the information about each facility (including name and description).

 <br>
 This link has census data from Los Angeles including percentages of total population and geographic distribution of all the different racial and ethnic groups within the area. This data will be downloaded as a csv file and import it into VS code to create a map of the demographic distribution in LA by blocks (if possible, by the service areas depicted in the map above). This will be a choropleth map and each area will present a marker when hoovered over with a mouse. The marker will have information about racial and ethnic percentages of the population living in that block.

 <br>
 This link has data about factors such as home stability and accessibility to mental health services in LA county. For this data we would have to create our own tables and import them as csv files into VS Code. The purpose of this data will be to further our narrative about the effects socioeconomic factors have on mental health treatment/accessibility with a layer on the demographic distribution choropleth map described above. This layer will also include markers with extra information about whcihever factor is being depicted. 
 <br>
 <br>
 <i>So far these are the visuals that we have in mind but the link below has a couple of more data sets, that if time allows, we would be open to explore and further our narrative (data about substance abuse programs, hospital and care centers, medicare and medicaid offices, health education and counseling, etc):</i>

Kate's reaction: I like how logical the flow is and the inclusion of public & private care facilities to map.

Frida's reaction: I really like all the material that is in the map! I think it is a great way to synthesize ideas and also can give us insight as to what we can possibly map about. I like how the ideas so clearly connect to each other and create a narrative within the mindmap.

Kate's reaction: You bring up really important questions about language barriers and gender and their relation to mental health. I also noticed how we both were thinking about the way mental health intersects with other public issues.

Frida's reaction: I really like that historical background idea! I think that it will be very useful in creating a complete idea as to what the issue is and how long it has been happening for. I also really liked how you delineated the narrative in a concise way and how you mentioned community-based approaches to the mental health crisis that LA county, and most of the country, is living in.
