<b><h1>Mental health in Los Angeles County</h1></b>

Introduction: 
Group name - The health mappers.
Group goals - We believe in health equity -- the idea that everybody should have access to healthy lives and life-affirming structures/institutions. With our project we hope to emphasize the lack of mental health accessibility and how this is an issue of racial and economic justice.

Team members: 

Frida Barragan - Group collaborator 1. Fourth year Biology major. I am interested in all aspects of healthcare but specifically in how accessibility to health services is affected by social factors that include income and location and how this intersects with race and ethnicity. 

Kate McInerny - Group collaborator 2. Third year Public Affairs major and DH Minor. I’m interested in critical cartography, mapping for racial justice & community-based organizing work. I believe that many of our “social issues” require a public health framework/ holistic approach so that communities can thrive.

Because we are a two-person team, we have decided we will split work equally as the project moves forward, rather than assigning strict “roles” for ourselves.

Overview:
Our group will focus on mental health in Los Angeles -- the availability of mental health facilities across the county, the geospatial politics around mental health, its stigmatization, criminalization, and prioritization across space and time. Our project is on mental health in Los Angeles because it is one of the least accessible services available to individuals living in this area. Understanding mental health is important since it is often overlooked in general discussions of health. Moreover, Los Angeles is currently experiencing a drug and homelessness crisis affecting thousands of individuals, whose mental health necessities are not being attended to and which could potentially result fatal. It is important to understand the needs of individuals living in an area and emphasize the shortcomings of the economic funds that have been allocated towards specific groups of people. Overall, our project is meant to showcase the intersections between lack of mental health services and other social issues that affect millions of lives.

Methodology:
Web mapping is a useful tool because it uses geographic data to create geospatial visuals of social issues and its various aspects, such as mental health access. We chose this medium because it could potentially create powerful visuals that show exactly how mental health services are unaccessible for certain population groups. Also, could create a perspective as to how much of the population and the locations that are being most affected by mental health accessibility issues.

Workflow:


Week
Task/Deliverable (by Sunday)
2
Project Proposal
3
Preliminary data exploration
Ask specific questions of our dataset
Enhance with additional literature review
Narrow in on intersecting issue(s) with mental health in LA
4
Preliminary data analysis 
Analyze findings: What are the general trends? Outliers? Do any questions arise from this data for further analysis?
5
Preliminary mapping
Code/visualize data
Analyze findings: What trends stand out in the map? What other questions arise here?
6
Flesh out narrative
Start to form a thesis/theme
Write Intro and short literature review (that is more focused in on our thesis and sets the stage for our data analysis)
What does our analysis add to the conversation?
7
Narrative/data work
Focus on which visualizations are most useful and insightful for our project: What adds to the conversation?
Clarify maps/visualizations & write analysis to continue narrative
8
Web design
Start designing web & beautifying maps/data into one aesthetic
Continue narrative development with data
9
Finalize narrative
Editing for clarity & conciseness
Forming one cohesive narrative with our data
10
Finalize website
Editing & technical touches



Technical scope:

Git - We will use Git to collaborate on the same files and have a record of the changes that are being made of our code. We will also use it to make sure our data is stored safely and we can always look back at it.  
Leaflet - We will use this tool to map all of our data sets and add markers to make interactive and appealing images that add to the overall narrative.
HTML - We will use HTML to display our images in a website that is user friendly and creates an impactful story that highlights the social issues and questions we are raising.
Javascript - We will use javascript and its functions as our programming language to make our website more interactive and better the user experience. 
Jupyter - We will use Jupyter to create static maps and map the demographic distributions of the Los Angeles population.
Tableau -  We will use Tableau to create histograms and charts to give variance to our story board and show our data in different ways.
Visual Studio Code - We will use Visual Studio Code to edit our html code and to make sure that the website we are creating works. We will use it to save our files into Github and push them into our URLs.

Data:
Trend data tables from the Department of Public Health in Los Angeles. This website has many different trend tables (for both children and adults) that include factors such as mental health and home stability.

Los Angeles demographic distribution from the Census Reporter separated by area blocks. This data includes percentages of total population and geographic distribution of all the different racial and enthic groups within Los Angeles County.
